Main Code information and updates for Powerplay Season 5795

Deluxe TeleOp:
Contains basic Mechanum functionality, drift stuff, 90 degree turns, and access to all other bot functions.
This includes the cone servo (for fallen cones), grip servo, and the vertical slide.
Includes adjustments to deal with drifting issues due to motors/weight (calibrate after major changes).

Deluxe Tele-Op Controls (Mostly combined in controller one for oneControllerTeleOp):
    Controller 1 (Driver):
        -Left stick for movement (with sqrt precision code)
        -Right stick for turn (without sqrt precision code)
        -Left bumper hold for drift (Bot continues moving in direction originally facing when button pressed regardless of orientation)
        -Right bumper hold halves speed for precision
        -D-Pad left/right sets bot to 90 degree locked positions relative to bot starting pose //TODO: Tuning
        -B button toggles the arm for pulling cones vertical
        -A button activates the vertical cone procedure (start with the arm side of the bot flush with cone) //TODO
        -X button locks bots position using Odometry to make it more resistant to opponents and overshoot //TODO: Tuning
    Controller 2 (Mechanisms):
        -D-Pad up/down moves the slides to set levels (ground, grab position, low pole, medium pole, high pole) //TODO: Tuning
        -X button automatically sets slides to first position (grab position) //TODO: Tuning
        -A button toggles the cone grabber

Autonomous:
-Road Runner Odometry needs to be tuned
-Some trajectories have been developed

Other function classes:
    -coneServoController (only tele-Op)
    -gripServoController (both tele-Op and auto)
    -vSlideMotorController (both tele-Op and auto)

NOTE- When using function classes for tele-op, use runOpMode() method in the primary while loop.
When using function classes for autonomous, use auto[function name] method once (not in a while loop).
Also make sure to initialize function class objects using hardwareMap.
