Deluxe TeleOp:
Contains basic Mechanum functionality, drift stuff, 90 degree turns, and access to all other bot functions.
This includes the cone servo (for fallen cones), grip servo, and the vertical slide.
Includes adjustments to deal with drifting issues due to motors/weight (calibrate after major changes).

Deluxe Tele-Op Controls (Mostly combined in controller one for oneControllerTeleOp):
    Controller 1 (Driver):
        -Left stick for movement (with sqrt precision code)
        -Right stick for turn (without sqrt precision code)
        -Left bumper hold for drift (Bot continues moving in direction originally facing when button pressed regardless of orientation)
        -Right bumper hold halves speed for precision
        -D-Pad left/right sets bot to 90 degree locked positions relative to bot starting pose //TODO: Tuning
    Controller 2 (Slides):
        -D-Pad down moves slides down when at scoring heights (10-12) and "up" grab positions (1,3,5,7,9)
        -D-Pad up moves slides up when at scoring heights (10-12) and sets slides to low pole (10) otherwise
        -Right bumper sets slides to "up" grab position (9) preparing for a 5-stack of cones
        -Y button sets slides to "up" grab position (7) preparing for a 4-stack of cones
        -X button sets slides to "up" grab position (5) preparing for a 3-stack of cones
        -B button sets slides to "up" grab position (3) preparing for a 2-stack of cones
        -A button sets slides to "up" grab position (1) preparing for a 1-stack of cones
        -Left bumper toggles the grip servo
        -Automatically opens grabber when going down for cone and closes when coming back up
        -Left and Right Analog Buttons combined reset the slides (overrides to level 0 as well) //TODO: Tuning
        -Holding left trigger reduces slide height relative to depth
        -Holding right trigger increases slide height relative to depth

Autonomous:
    Odometry:
    -All functions tuned with three dead wheel tracking
    Roadrunner:
    -Finite State Machine //TODO: Tuning
    -Camera EXA left/right tuned for parking
    -TODO: In Progress

Other function classes:
    -coneServoController (only tele-Op)
    -gripServoController (both tele-Op and auto)
    -vSlideMotorController (both tele-Op and auto)
